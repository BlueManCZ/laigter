# Laigter

Laigter is a tool that automatically generates maps for dynamic lighting effects in games. It allows normal, parallax, specular and occlusion map generation. Also, it allows the user to preview how the effect will look ingame.
You can get binaries from itch.io: https://azagaya.itch.io/laigter

Laigter is available in english and spanish. It should automatically detect your PC language.

## Prerequisites

You need Qt framework (online installer is the recommended way to get it) and opencv 3.2 or above. Opencv is not meant for tools like this, but is the one i'm used to. In the future it would be nice to do without it.
